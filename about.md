I'm a Software Engineer, currently focused on backend development with technologies such as Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and Elixir. I have a particular interest in APIs and I'm experienced working with REST APIs, GraphQL and webservices.

I also have a background in music, which has taught me how to think on my feet, communicate effectively, and work in a team. These skills have served me well in my current role, where I am able to think creatively and work collaboratively to achieve results, always looking for connecting ideas and individuals, bridging the gap between a product's idealization and its implementation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, exploring new technologies, and spending time with my family. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
